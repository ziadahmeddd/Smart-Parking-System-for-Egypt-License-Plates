# Model Files - Not Included in Git

Due to file size limitations, the following model files are **not included** in this repository:

## Required Model Files:

### 1. YOLO Models (Detection)
- **`plate_detector.pt`** - License plate detection model
  - Size: ~6MB
  - Used by: `maquette_main.py`, `smart_logger.py`
  
- **`character_detector.pt`** - Character recognition model
  - Size: ~6MB
  - Used by: `maquette_main.py`, `smart_logger.py`

### 2. TD3 Model (AI Allocation)
- **`td3_actor.pth`** - Trained parking allocation agent
  - Size: ~50KB
  - Generated by: `train_simulation.py`
  - Used by: `maquette_main.py` (via `td3_parking.py`)

### 3. Font File
- **`NotoSansArabic-Regular.ttf`** - Arabic text rendering
  - Size: ~400KB
  - Download from: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Arabic)

---

## 📥 How to Get Model Files

### Option 1: Train Your Own (Recommended)
```bash
# Train TD3 model (takes ~1 minute)
python train_simulation.py
# Creates: td3_actor.pth
```

### Option 2: Download Pre-trained Models
Contact the repository owner for access to pre-trained models, or train your own YOLO models using the `dataset/` folder.

### Option 3: Use Your Own YOLO Models
If you have your own trained YOLO models for:
- Arabic/license plate detection
- Character recognition

Simply place them in the project root and update `config.py`:
```python
PLATE_MODEL_PATH = "your_plate_model.pt"
CHAR_MODEL_PATH = "your_char_model.pt"
```

## 📁 Project Structure After Setup

After obtaining all model files, your directory should look like:

```
SmartParkingSystem/
├── config.py
├── database.py
├── simple_blockchain.py
├── td3_parking.py
├── train_simulation.py
├── maquette_main.py
├── logger.py
├── smart_logger.py
│
├── plate_detector.pt          ← Add this
├── character_detector.pt      ← Add this
├── td3_actor.pth             ← Train or add this
├── NotoSansArabic-Regular.ttf ← Download this

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit large model files to Git** - They bloat the repository
2. **TD3 model can be retrained** - Run `train_simulation.py` (fast!)
3. **YOLO models are project-specific** - You may need to train on your own dataset
4. **Font file is freely available** - Download from Google Fonts

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

After cloning the repository:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Add model files (manually)
# - Copy YOLO models to project root
# - Download Arabic font

# 3. Train TD3 model
python train_simulation.py

# 4. Test the system
python smart_logger.py test_images
```
